# Jupiter Notebook execution guide

This project contains a set of Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) that demonstrate [briefly describe what the notebooks do]. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up the environment and execute the notebooks.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the notebooks, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python** (version 3.7 or above) - [Python Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab** - [Jupyter Installation Guide](https://jupyter.org/install)
- Recommended: **Git** - [Git Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. **Set up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the Required Python Packages:**
    The required dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If there's no `requirements.txt`, manually install the dependencies listed in the notebooks using:
    ```bash
    pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib  # Add other necessary libraries here
    ```

## Running the Notebooks

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
    You can launch Jupyter Notebook from the terminal using the following command:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your default web browser.

2. **Navigate to the Folder**:
    In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the directory containing the `.ipynb` files and click on the notebook you wish to run.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
    Once the notebook is open, you can execute each cell sequentially by selecting the cell and pressing `Shift + Enter`. You can also run all cells at once by selecting **Kernel > Restart & Run All**.

## FAQ

**Q: What should I do if I get an ImportError for a missing library?**  
A: Ensure youâ€™ve installed the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. If the error persists, manually install the missing package using `pip install <package_name>`.

**Q: How do I stop the Jupyter server?**  
A: Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running, then press `y` to confirm.

**Q: Can I run these notebooks without installing Jupyter on my local machine?**  
A: Yes! You can upload the notebooks to Google Colab and run them in your browser. Simply open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), upload the `.ipynb` file, and execute the cells as needed.
